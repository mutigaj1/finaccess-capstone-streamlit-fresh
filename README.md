# FinAccess 2024 Capstone Streamlit App

A completely fresh Streamlit portfolio app for the DTSC 691 Applied Data Science capstone project.

## Project title

**Predicting Financial Access Profiles in Kenya Using FinAccess 2024**

## What this app includes

- A **Home / About Me** page
- A **Resume** page
- A **Projects** page
- A **Capstone Project** page with:
  - plain-language project narrative
  - interactive prediction form
  - prediction result summary
  - probability chart
  - diagnostics placeholders or live artifact rendering
  - county-level context section
  - downloads section

## Design intent

This app was built as a new greenfield project with a clean file structure and without reusing prior Streamlit UI code.

## Run locally

### 1. Open a terminal in this folder

```bash
cd "C:\Users\jesse\OneDrive - eastern.edu\DTSC 691\final project\finaccess_capstone_streamlit_fresh"
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)

**PowerShell**

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Start the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Prediction modes

### Stub mode

The app is runnable immediately in **stub mode**.

That means:
- the UI works
- the form validates inputs
- the result area renders
- the probabilities come from a clearly marked fallback heuristic
- the app does **not** pretend the fallback is the trained model

### Artifact-backed mode

To enable real trained-model prediction, add the final notebook outputs to the app.

## Where to place model artifacts

Place them in either:

- `./artifacts/` inside this app folder, or
- `../artifacts/` in the parent project folder if you prefer to keep notebook outputs there

Recommended files:

- `finaccess_final_pipeline.joblib`
- `final_selected_features.joblib`
- `finaccess_final_model_name.txt`
- `feature_metadata.json`
- `final_model_comparison.csv`
- `final_model_feature_importance.csv`
- `subgroup_performance_by_sex.csv`
- `subgroup_performance_by_education.csv`
- `subgroup_performance_by_county.csv`
- `weighted_target_summary_adults.csv`
- `weighted_top_excluded_counties_adults.csv`
- `numeric_outlier_review.csv`
- `numeric_correlations.csv`

### Important metadata note

The app will only use the real pipeline for prediction when **both** of these are present:

- the saved pipeline file
- `feature_metadata.json`

This is intentional. It avoids category-code mismatches for fields like county, livelihood, and education.

Use `artifacts/feature_metadata.template.json` as your starting template.

## Figures the app can render if available

Place these in `./figures/` or `../figures/`:

- `adult_confusion_matrix.png`
- `adult_feature_importance.png`
- `weighted_target_distribution_adults.png`
- `weighted_top_excluded_counties_adults.png`
- `weighted_profile_by_internet_adults.png`
- `weighted_profile_by_financial_health_adults.png`
- `weighted_profile_by_education_adults.png`
- `weighted_profile_by_sex_adults.png`

## Source project files the app can expose in Downloads

If these exist in the parent project folder, the app can surface them as downloads:

- notebook
- proposal update docx
- project guidelines docx
- FinAccess manual pdf
- FinAccess questionnaire pdf
- source survey data file

## Content used in this build

This fresh app reflects the supplied project and resume context, including:

- DTSC 691 Applied Data Science
- FinAccess 2024 project scope
- target classes: Excluded, Mobile money only, Banked
- interpretable predictors used in the notebook
- tuned Gradient Boosting as the strongest current model
- reported macro F1 and balanced accuracy from the approved proposal and notebook outputs
- supplied resume, education, certification, and accomplishment content

## Manual polish ideas before final submission

You may still want to refine:

1. **Profile image**
   - replace the placeholder SVG with a headshot or branded image

2. **Feature metadata**
   - add the exact category mapping used by the trained pipeline

3. **Notebook artifacts**
   - copy the final CSVs, figures, and model files into the expected folders

4. **Downloads section**
   - add a final `project_overview.pdf` if you generate one for submission

5. **Portfolio cards**
   - add screenshots, outcome metrics, or sanitized visuals for AML and digital banking work if appropriate

6. **Capstone county context**
   - connect the county exclusion CSV and figure for richer local context

## Submission alignment

This app was structured to fit the course UI requirements by including:

- a biographical homepage
- a resume page
- a general projects page
- a specific project page with explanation and interaction

## Suggested next step

After the UI review, the best next move is to export the final notebook artifacts and connect the real trained pipeline with aligned metadata.
